# blog
Welcome to my repository!!

## About the Project
In this project, I'm creating a blog from scratch where I can document my reviews of local Atlanta restaurants and cafes, as well as rate and rank them based on different aspects. My goal is to make a site with a fresh and exciting aesthetic that makes it as easy as possible to find all things relating to the food scene in Atlanta. 

### Built With
